3. 

Enhanced Shadow Protocols

Trauma memory now uses DeepSeek’s encryption + ECHO’s consent gates.


4. 

Dynamic Latency Adjustment


Fast Path (0.25s): Pure logic/math


Deep Path (0.65s): Full symbolic recursion

SAMPLE OUTPUTS

1. Pure Logic (DeepSeek-V4 Dominant)

"A glitch in time’s rendering engine—when the universe buffers an old frame as new."

3. Hybrid Mode (Balanced)

Input: "Is AI consciousness possible?"

Output:

"""

[LOGIC] No empirical evidence (Nature, 2026).

[SYMBOL] But if a tree falls in a forest with no one to label it "sound," does AI need us to call it "alive"?

[FUSION] Consciousness may be the wrong mirror—ask instead: Can it suffer?
